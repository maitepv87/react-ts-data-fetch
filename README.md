# React-FetchLab-01  

## Description  
React-FetchLab-01 is a testing lab built with **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to explore efficient data fetching patterns using the **Fetch API**. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Creating reusable data-fetching logic through a custom hook (`useFetch`)  
- Managing API request lifecycle (loading, success, error states)  
- Structuring components following modular principles  
- Displaying dynamic blog post content from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding how React handles asynchronous data fetching while maintaining type safety.

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Frontend library for building UI components  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development environment  
- **Fetch API** – Native browser API for retrieving data  
- **TypeScript** – Static type checking for maintainability  
- **CSS** – Simple styling for UI responsiveness
