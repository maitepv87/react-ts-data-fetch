<!-- # React TS Data Fetch

This is a React application built with TypeScript, featuring a reusable custom hook (`useFetch`) for fetching data from an API and displaying blog posts dynamically.

## Features

- Developed with **React and TypeScript** for type safety and scalability
- Utilizes a **custom hook (`useFetch`)** for reusable API requests
- Modular architecture structured under `blog/`
- Proper handling of loading states and error messages

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maitepv87/react-ts-data-fetch.git
cd react-ts-data-fetch

# React-FetchLab-01  

## Description  
React-FetchLab-01 is a testing lab built with **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to explore efficient data fetching patterns using the **Fetch API**. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Creating reusable data-fetching logic through a custom hook (`useFetch`)  
- Managing API request lifecycle (loading, success, error states)  
- Structuring components following modular principles  
- Displaying dynamic blog post content from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding how React handles asynchronous data fetching while maintaining type safety.

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Frontend library for building UI components  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development environment  
- **Fetch API** – Native browser API for retrieving data  
- **TypeScript** – Static type checking for maintainability  
- **CSS** – Simple styling for UI responsiveness  

## Getting Started
